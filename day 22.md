# Training Day 22 Report  
**Date:** 29 June 2024  
**Location:** Science & Technology Entrepreneurs' Park

Today’s focus was to make the **Subject Tabs** functional and improve the overall **UI experience** of the dashboard using Bootstrap and JavaScript.

###  What I Did:

1. **Subject Tabs Creation:**
   - Used Bootstrap `nav-tabs` to create clickable tabs for subjects.
   - Each tab showed content like course description, faculty name, and links to notes or resources.

2. **Dynamic Tab Content:**
   - Created JavaScript-based content rendering inside each subject pane.
   - Displayed content only when a tab is clicked using `Bootstrap.Tab` JavaScript APIs.

3. **Enhancing Layout:**
   - Applied Bootstrap’s spacing, card, and grid utilities to keep sections well-spaced and responsive.
   - Added hover effects and box shadows for a modern look.

4. **Refinements:**
   - Fixed bugs in the timetable rendering.
   - Made sure the dashboard works smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

###  Summary:
The Subject Tabs are now dynamic and user-friendly, offering students quick access to academic resources. The site layout is more polished and feels modern.
