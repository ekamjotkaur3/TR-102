**Training Day 2 Report:**  
**Date:** 6 June 2024

**Location:** Science & Technology Entrepreneurs' Park  

Continuing from Day 1, this session focused on integrating content with visuals and navigation in HTML. We also started linking basic CSS to enhance the styling and presentation of our web pages. The importance of user interface, page structure, and content accessibility was emphasized. Through a mix of theory and hands-on activities, we explored additional core HTML features and their interaction with CSS for better page aesthetics.

### Extended Topics:

#### 2.1.8 HTML Comments
- Added comments in HTML for code readability and documentation.
- Comments are inserted using `<!-- Comment text here -->`.
- These comments are not rendered on the webpage but serve as useful notes or reminders for developers.
- We used comments to section off different parts of our HTML code like header, navigation, body, and footer for better organization.
- Comments also helped during collaborative work, especially for understanding the code blocks written by others.

#### 2.1.9 HTML Colors
- Implemented colors using three main methods:
  - **Color names:** such as `red`, `blue`, `green`, etc.
  - **Hex codes:** for example, `#ff0000` for red, `#00ff00` for green.
  - **RGB values:** e.g., `rgb(255, 0, 0)` for red, `rgb(0, 255, 0)` for green.
- We were encouraged to experiment with background colors, text colors, and border colors using the inline `style` attribute.
- The session included a small color-picking activity using color pickers online to find hex codes and apply them creatively to HTML elements.

#### 2.1.10 HTML CSS Integration
- Connected HTML files to CSS using:
  - `<style>` tag for internal CSS (within the `<head>`).
  - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` for external CSS.
  - Inline styles using `style="..."` inside HTML tags.
- Discussed the pros and cons of each method:
  - Inline is quick but not scalable.
  - Internal is suitable for single-page documents.
  - External is preferred for larger projects with multiple pages.
- We wrote a sample external stylesheet and linked it to our HTML document to change font families, colors, and layout.
- Emphasized separation of concerns â€“ content in HTML and design in CSS.

#### 2.1.11 HTML Links
- Used `<a href="...">` to add hyperlinks to other pages and websites.
- Created:
  - **Internal links** pointing to different sections within the same document or site.
  - **External links** to other websites like `https://www.wikipedia.org`.
  - **Email links** using `mailto:someone@example.com`.
- Opened links in new tabs using `target="_blank"` and explained its usability for external websites.
- Also learned about using `title` attribute for tooltips and `download` attribute for downloadable files.

#### 2.1.12 HTML Images
- Used the `<img>` tag with essential attributes:
  - `src` for image source URL or file path.
  - `alt` for alternative text (important for accessibility and SEO).
  - `height` and `width` for sizing images.
- We practiced placing images in different parts of the webpage and aligning them using CSS.
- Discussed the difference between image formats:
  - **JPG:** Good for photos.
  - **PNG:** Supports transparency.
  - **SVG:** Vector-based, scalable without loss of quality.
  - **WebP:** Modern format offering compression with quality.
- An activity involved adding profile images to a mock portfolio.

#### 2.1.13 HTML Page Title
- Set the page title using the `<title>` tag placed within the `<head>` section.
- Observed how this title appears on the browser tab.
- Also explained how search engines use the title tag as the clickable link in search results.
- Emphasized using meaningful and keyword-rich titles for better SEO.
- Practiced modifying titles for sample pages like "My Resume", "My Portfolio", etc.

#### 2.1.14 HTML Tables
- Built tables using:
  - `<table>` to define the table.
  - `<tr>` for table rows.
  - `<th>` for header cells.
  - `<td>` for data cells.
- Used advanced attributes:
  - `colspan` to merge columns.
  - `rowspan` to merge rows.
  - `border` to define table border.
  - `cellpadding` and `cellspacing` for spacing adjustments.
- We created a basic timetable as an exercise using all these elements.
- Learned how tables can also be styled with CSS for borders, hover effects, and striping rows.

#### 2.1.15 HTML Layout (Semantic)
- Learned about semantic HTML tags that give meaning to page structure:
  - `<header>` for the top section, usually containing logo and title.
  - `<footer>` for the bottom section, often with copyright.
  - `<nav>` for navigation links.
  - `<article>` for self-contained content.
  - `<section>` for grouping related content.
  - `<aside>` for side content or widgets.
- Compared semantic tags with non-semantic ones like `<div>` and `<span>`.
- Practiced building a simple web layout using all the semantic tags to enhance accessibility and maintainability.
- Explained how screen readers and search engines benefit from semantic HTML.

> The day ended with a hands-on assignment to build a single-page resume layout using all the tags and concepts covered so far.

The resume included:
- A **header** with the candidate's name and title.
- A **navigation bar** linking to sections like Education, Skills, and Projects.
- A **profile image** using the `<img>` tag.
- An **"About Me"** section with a paragraph and some formatting tags.
- A **Skills table** showcasing languages and proficiency levels.
- Semantic structure for each section using `<section>` and `<article>`.
- A styled footer with contact information and social media links.

This exercise was instrumental in applying the theoretical concepts into practice. It not only reinforced HTML syntax but also introduced real-world structuring practices. Students were encouraged to submit their resume pages for review and feedback.

The second day significantly improved our understanding of web page visual elements and foundational layout structure. With the addition of images, links, and CSS integration, our HTML pages started looking more like actual websites. These concepts are crucial stepping stones before diving into advanced styling with CSS and interactivity using JavaScript in the coming sessions.
