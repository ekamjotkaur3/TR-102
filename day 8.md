**Date:** 13 June 2024  

**Location:** Science & Technology Entrepreneurs' Park  

**Project Title:** *CSS Selectors â€“ Targeting HTML Elements Effectively*

---

On Day 8, we explored CSS selectors, which allow us to precisely target HTML elements for styling based on various attributes and relationships.

### Learning Objectives:  
- Learn different types of CSS selectors.  
- Practice using selectors like element, id, class, universal, and grouping selectors.

---

### Key Topics Covered:

**CSS Selectors**  
Selectors "find" HTML elements you want to style. We covered five main categories:  
- Simple selectors (element, id, class)  
- Combinator selectors  
- Pseudo-class and pseudo-element selectors  
- Attribute selectors  

Examples:  

```css
/* Element selector */
p { 
  color: red; 
  text-align: center; 
}

/* ID selector */
#para1 { 
  color: red; 
  text-align: center; 
}

/* Class selector */
.center { 
  color: red; 
  text-align: center; 
}

/* Universal selector */
* { 
  color: blue; 
  text-align: center; 
}

/* Grouping selector */
h1, h2, p { 
  color: red; 
  text-align: center; 
}

Learned how to select elements efficiently for targeted styling.
