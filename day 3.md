**Training Day 3 Report:**  
**Date:** 7 June 2024

**Location:** Science & Technology Entrepreneurs' Park  

**Project Title:** *How to Link Different Web Pages using HTML*

The main objective of Day 3 was to create **multi-page websites** using hyperlinks. This session built upon the foundational knowledge of HTML elements and introduced inter-page linking to simulate real-world website structures. We learned how individual HTML pages can be connected to form a complete and functional website. Through live demonstrations and a hands-on mini project, we focused on linking, navigation menus, and consistent layout design.

### Concepts Practiced:

#### Anchor Tags
- The anchor tag `<a>` is the primary HTML element used to create hyperlinks between web pages.
- Syntax used:
  ```html
  <a href="page.html">Page Name</a>
