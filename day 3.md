**Project Title:** *How to Link Different Web Pages using HTML*

The main objective of Day 3 was to create **multi-page websites** using hyperlinks.

### Concepts Practiced:

- **Anchor Tags**
  - Syntax: `<a href="page.html">Page Name</a>`
  - Navigated between multiple HTML files.

- **Relative vs Absolute URLs**
  - Learned folder structure and linking pages inside subdirectories.

- **Navigation Menu**
  - Created horizontal and vertical menus using lists.
  - Used `<nav>` for semantic grouping.

- **Back and Home Links**
  - Included return-to-home links on every subpage.
  - Ensured seamless UX.

### Example:

```html
<a href="index.html">Home</a> |
<a href="about.html">About</a> |
<a href="projects.html">Projects</a> |
<a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
```

### Mini Project:
We created a 4-page website:
- **Home** – Introduction
- **About Me** – Background details
- **Projects** – Simple portfolio
- **Contact** – Contact form (HTML only)

> Focus was on ensuring correct linking between all pages, no broken URLs, and consistent layout across pages.
