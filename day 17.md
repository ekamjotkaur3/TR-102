# Training Day 17 Report  
**Date:** 24 June 2024  
**Location:** Science & Technology Entrepreneurs' Park  

Today, I began working on my individual web development project — building my personal portfolio website using everything I’ve learned so far: **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**.

---

## What I Planned:

Before starting the actual coding, I planned the structure of my website. I decided to include the following sections:

- Home  
- About Me  
- Education  
- Skills  
- Projects  
- Hobbies  
- Contact  

I also sketched a rough layout to decide how I wanted each section to look — including headers, images, buttons, and forms.

---

## What I Did:

### 1. Setting Up the Project:
- Created a new folder for the project.
- Made a basic HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS file (`style.css`).
- Linked the CSS file to HTML using:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

---

### 2. Writing Basic HTML:
- Used proper structure with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
- Created a navigation bar using Bootstrap classes (e.g. `navbar`, `navbar-expand`, `navbar-light`, `bg-light`).
- Added links to jump to different sections like About, Skills, etc.

---

### 3. Designing the Home Section:
- Wrote a welcome message using `<h1>` and `<p>`.
- Added a professional image using `<img>` with Bootstrap's `img-fluid` class to make it responsive.
- Styled it using CSS for spacing and alignment.

---

### 4. Bootstrap Integration:
- Linked Bootstrap CSS via CDN.
- Used Bootstrap classes to start making the page mobile-friendly.

---

## Summary:
By the end of Day 17, I had completed the homepage layout, navbar, and added a few content sections with proper HTML structure. I also linked Bootstrap for easier styling and layout.
