# Training Day 23 Report  
**Date:** 30 June 2024  
**Location:** Science & Technology Entrepreneurs' Park

This was the final day of working on my **Student Dashboard** project. I completed the remaining sections and reviewed the full project for responsiveness, user experience, and functionality.

###  What I Did:

1. **Contact & Footer Section:**
   - Added a simple contact form using Bootstrap form components.
   - Included a footer with copyright.

2. **Smooth Scrolling:**
   - Applied `scroll-behavior: smooth;` in CSS to allow smooth navigation between sections when clicking navbar items.

3. **Performance & Code Review:**
   - Cleaned up unnecessary scripts and unused styles.
   - Validated the HTML using W3C Validator.
   - Optimized JS functions and tested everything again for bugs.

4. **Final Testing:**
   - Tested across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
   - Checked mobile responsiveness on various devices.

###  Summary:
My Student Dashboard project is now complete! It includes a live timetable, attendance tracker, subject tabs, and more. I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript efficiently and learned how to manage a larger multi-section project.
