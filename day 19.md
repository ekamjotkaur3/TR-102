# Training Day 19 Report  
**Date:** 26 June 2024  
**Location:** Science & Technology Entrepreneurs' Park  

This was the final day of working on my individual project. I focused on completing the remaining sections — **Projects**, **Hobbies**, and **Contact** — and finalized the overall design.

## What I Did:

### 1. Projects Section:
- Added 2–3 sample projects I had worked on.
- Each project was displayed inside a Bootstrap card with:
  - **Project name** (`<h3>`)
  - **Description**
  - **Link to view the project** (`<a href="..." target="_blank">View</a>`)
  - Optional image or icon

### 2. Hobbies Section:
- Listed hobbies using styled cards or lists with icons.
- Used CSS to apply background color and rounded corners.

### 3. Contact Section:
- Created a simple contact form with:
  - Name (`<input type="text">`)
  - Email (`<input type="email">`)
  - Message (`<textarea>`)
  - Submit Button
- Used JavaScript to show a success message when the form is submitted:

```javascript
function submitForm() {
  alert("Thank you! Your message has been sent.");
}
```

### 4. Final Touches:
- Added smooth scroll behavior using CSS (`scroll-behavior: smooth;`).
- Made sure the website was mobile-responsive by testing it on different screen sizes.
- Validated the HTML code to ensure no missing or extra tags.
- Checked all links and buttons were working properly.

## Summary:
By the end of **Day 19**, I had successfully completed my personal portfolio website using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**. I learned how to build a fully responsive, visually appealing, and interactive website. This project helped me combine all my learning into a real-world task, and I feel more confident in my front-end web development skills.
