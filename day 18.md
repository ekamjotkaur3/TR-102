# Training Day 18 Report  
**Date:** 25 June 2024  
**Location:** Science & Technology Entrepreneurs' Park  

Today, I worked on expanding my portfolio by adding more content sections and started applying CSS and Bootstrap styling. I also added some JavaScript to make parts of the site interactive.

---

## What I Did:

### 1. About Me & Education Section:
- Used `<section>` tags to organize each part clearly.  
- Wrote about myself using `<h2>`, `<p>`, and added an image.  
- For Education, I used an unordered list (`<ul>`) and styled it with Bootstrap’s `list-group` classes.  

### 2. Skills Section:
- Created a skills list using `<div>` cards.  
- Used Bootstrap Grid System (`row` and `col`) to display skills in columns.  
- Added custom icons for each skill using **Bootstrap Icons** or **Font Awesome**.  

### 3. CSS Styling:
- Customized text color, padding, margins using external CSS.  
- Added hover effects to buttons and links using the `:hover` pseudo-class.  

### 4. JavaScript Work:
- Wrote a small JavaScript snippet that displays a welcome alert when the page loads:

```javascript
window.onload = function() {
  alert("Welcome to my Portfolio Website!");
}
```

- Started learning how to make interactive buttons (e.g., "Show More" or "Hide Info").

## Summary:
I’m now more confident using a mix of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap together. I also started using JavaScript to bring small dynamic features to the page.
