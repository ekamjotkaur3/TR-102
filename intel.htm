    <h1 style="color:#333;">About Me</h1>
    <h3 style="color:red;">Who is Ekam?</h3>
    <p>I‚Äôm a tech student and a hobbyist who enjoys solving mysteries and making delicious food.</p>
    <p>  I‚Äôm a curious soul who finds joy in two very different but equally fascinating worlds: mystery shows and cooking. I love solving puzzles and uncovering secrets in the shows I watch, and when I‚Äôm not glued to the screen, you‚Äôll find me trying out new recipes or inventing my own. This site is my personal space to share the things I love ‚Äî welcome aboard!</p>

<p>Currently, I‚Äôm pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). My academic journey has given me a deep appreciation for logic, problem-solving, and creativity ‚Äî which are the very same skills I enjoy applying in both mystery shows and cooking! Whether it‚Äôs writing code to solve a real-world problem or decoding a suspenseful storyline, I find joy in thinking critically and exploring new ideas.</p>

<p>Balancing tech with my hobbies has helped me grow in unique ways ‚Äî from debugging code to mastering a new recipe, I believe that learning never stops. Through this website, I hope to share not just what I love, but also how I learn, create, and have fun along the way.</p>

<h3  style="color:red;">Top 5 Mystery Shows</h3>

<h2> What Are Mystery Shows?</h2>
<p> Mystery shows are gripping narratives that revolve around solving a crime or unraveling a mystery. They keep you guessing, often filled with twists and turns, while following detectives, investigators, or regular people trying to crack a case. These shows are a thrilling ride that challenges the mind and pulls you deeper into the story as it unfolds. </p>
<h2> 1.Sherlock(BBC)</h2>

<p>A modern, fast-paced version of the classic Sherlock Holmes stories. This series follows the brilliant but eccentric detective Sherlock Holmes (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) and his partner Dr. John Watson (played by Martin Freeman) as they solve complex cases using sharp logic and cutting-edge technology. The dynamic between the characters, along with the clever storytelling and mind-bending mysteries, makes it a must-watch for any mystery lover.</p>
<h2> 2.Stranger Things </h2>
<p>While Stranger Things is known for its supernatural elements, it‚Äôs also a mystery at heart. A group of kids in the 1980s discovers strange occurrences in their small town, leading them to uncover a government experiment and a parallel universe. As the group navigates the mysteries of the Upside Down, they uncover deeper secrets and face unknown threats. It‚Äôs a unique blend of sci-fi, horror, and mystery, with a lot of heart and suspense.</p>

<h2>3.Criminal Minds</h2>
<p>Criminal Minds focuses on the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU), which solves crimes by profiling and understanding the psychology of criminals. Each episode presents a different case, typically involving violent crimes like serial murders or kidnappings, and explores how the team identifies and tracks down the perpetrator. The show is intense, fascinating, and sheds light on the darker side of the human mind.</p>
<h2>4.Dark (German)</h2>

<p>Dark is a complex time-travel mystery that blends science fiction and suspense. Set in a small German town, the series follows multiple families and their interwoven destinies over several generations. With a mysterious disappearance leading to the discovery of time travel, Dark explores themes of fate, free will, and paradoxes, all while building a dense, multi-layered plot that keeps you hooked. It‚Äôs a truly mind-bending show that requires your full attention, but it rewards with brilliant storytelling.</p>
<h2>5.Only Murders in the Building.</h2>

<p>A quirky and light-hearted mystery show that takes a more comedic approach. The series follows three strangers, played by Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez, who live in a luxury apartment building in New York. After a murder occurs in their building, they start their own podcast to investigate the crime, all while becoming amateur detectives. It‚Äôs a fun, charming, and full of surprises, blending mystery with humor and touching moments.</p>

<h3  style="color:red;">My Go-To Dishes in the Kitchen</h3>
<h2> 1. Creamy Garlic Pasta</h2>

<p>This dish is my ultimate comfort food. It‚Äôs simple to make yet packs so much flavor. I love the creamy, garlicky sauce that coats each strand of pasta. The richness of the cream combined with the savory depth of garlic and Parmesan is a match made in heaven. It‚Äôs the kind of dish that feels indulgent but doesn‚Äôt require a lot of time in the kitchen. I often throw in a little bit of saut√©ed spinach or grilled chicken to make it a complete meal. Whether it's a busy weeknight or a lazy weekend, this pasta never disappoints</p>
<h2> 2.Chocolate Chip Cookies </h2>
<p>Who can resist a warm, freshly baked chocolate chip cookie? I‚Äôve spent years perfecting my recipe, and I think I've finally nailed it. The key is in the balance between the crispy edge and the soft, gooey center. When baking, I like to use a mix of semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips for that perfect chocolatey bite. I often add a pinch of sea salt on top right before baking ‚Äî it enhances the sweetness and adds a little something extra. These cookies are always a crowd-pleaser, and they disappear faster than you can say "cookie monster"!</p>

<h2>3.Mixed Veggie Salad</h2>
<p>For those days when I want something fresh and healthy, this salad is my go-to. It's filled with a variety of colorful vegetables, from crunchy cucumbers and bell peppers to juicy tomatoes and fresh lettuce. I love adding some avocado for creaminess and roasted nuts or seeds for a bit of crunch. The dressing is a simple vinaigrette made from olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and Dijon mustard ‚Äî tangy and zesty, just the way I like it. Not only is this salad refreshing, but it also makes a great side dish to balance out any heavy meal. Plus, it's packed with vitamins and nutrients, so you can't go wrong!</p>
<h2>4.Butter Paneer </h2>

<p>Rich, creamy, and full of bold spices ‚Äî this dish is a true indulgence. Butter Paneer is one of my absolute favorites when I‚Äôm craving something flavorful and hearty. The soft cubes of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) are simmered in a luscious, spiced tomato gravy made with butter, cream, and a mix of aromatic Indian spices. The result is a dish that‚Äôs velvety smooth and full of flavor. I love serving this with warm naan or basmati rice, and I can‚Äôt resist a little extra drizzle of cream on top. Whether you‚Äôre a fan of Indian food or new to it, butter paneer is a dish that never fails to impress.</p>
<h2>5.No-Bake Cheesecake</h2>

<p>If I‚Äôm craving something sweet but don‚Äôt want to spend hours baking, this no-bake cheesecake is my solution. It's incredibly easy to make, and you don‚Äôt even need to turn on the oven! The base is made from crushed graham crackers mixed with melted butter, and the creamy filling is a blend of cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla. After chilling in the fridge for a few hours, the cheesecake sets into a smooth, velvety texture that‚Äôs both rich and refreshing. To top it off, I often add a drizzle of berry compote or a handful of fresh fruits like strawberries and blueberries. It‚Äôs the perfect dessert for any occasion ‚Äî simple yet decadent.
