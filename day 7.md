**Project Title:** *Introduction to CSS â€“ What is CSS & How to Use it in HTML*

---

On Day 7, we focused on understanding what CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is and how it integrates with HTML to control the presentation of web pages.

### Learning Objectives:  
- Understand the purpose and advantages of CSS.  
- Learn the three ways to apply CSS in HTML: Inline, Internal, and External.  

---

### Key Topics Covered:

**What is CSS?**  
CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe how HTML elements should be displayed across various media such as screens and printers. It saves effort by controlling the layout of multiple web pages simultaneously.

**Using CSS in HTML**  
We explored three methods:  
- **Inline CSS** applies styles directly within HTML tags.  
- **Internal CSS** involves defining styles inside a `<style>` tag in the HTML `<head>`.  
- **External CSS** links an external `.css` file via the `<link>` element for styling multiple pages.

### Sample Code:

<h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>

<!-- Internal CSS -->
<style>
  body {background-color: powderblue;}
  h1 {color: blue;}
  p {color: red;}
</style>

<!-- External CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
