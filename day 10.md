### Key Topics Covered:

#### CSS Explained  
Every HTML element is represented as a rectangular box that consists of four layers, from inside to outside:

1. **Content**  
   This is the actual text, image, or other media inside the element. The size of the content area is controlled by properties such as `width` and `height`.

2. **Padding**  
   Padding is the space between the content and the element’s border. It creates breathing room inside the element without affecting the external layout. Padding adds to the total size of the element, increasing its visual footprint.

3. **Border**  
   The border wraps around the padding and content. Borders can vary in width, style, and color, and visually separate elements or add emphasis.

4. **Margin**  
   Margins are the outermost space, creating gaps between the element and adjacent elements. Margins do not add to the element’s size but control external spacing.
